Ingredients

1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided

1 16-ounce package shelf-stable gnocchi

½ cup sliced shallots

1 bunch asparagus (about 1 pound), trimmed and cut into thirds

¾ cup reduced-sodium chicken broth

1 pound raw shrimp (26-30 per pound), peeled and deveined, tails left on if desired

¼ teaspoon freshly ground pepper

Pinch of salt

2 tablespoons lemon juice

⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese



Directions

Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat.

Add gnocchi and cook, stirring often, until plumped and golden in spots, 6 to 10 minutes.

Transfer to a bowl.

Add the remaining 2 teaspoons oil and shallots to the pan; cook over medium heat,
stirring, until beginning to brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in asparagus and broth.

Cover and cook until the asparagus is barely tender, 3 to 4 minutes. 

Add shrimp, pepper and salt; cover and simmer until the shrimp is pink and just cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes more.

Return the gnocchi to the skillet along with lemon juice and cook, stirring, until heated through, about 2 minutes.

Remove from the heat, sprinkle with cheese, cover and let stand until the cheese is melted, about 2 minutes.
