Ingredients

¼ cup pepitas

¼ cup sesame seeds

¼ cup sunflower seeds

1 ½ teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil

½ teaspoon kosher salt, divided

¼ cup whole-milk plain Greek yogurt

2 tablespoons tahini

1 tablespoon water

1 ½ teaspoons cider vinegar

1 teaspoon lemon juice

10 cups torn stemmed kale leaves (from 2 bunches)

1 ripe pear, thinly sliced

¼ medium red onion, thinly sliced

1 cup fresh mint, divided

½ cup crumbled feta cheese



Directions

Preheat oven to 325 degrees F.

Spread pepitas, sesame seeds and sunflower seeds on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake, stirring once, until lightly toasted, about 10 minutes.

Immediately scrape the seeds into a medium bowl and toss with oil and 1/8 teaspoon salt. 

Let cool to room temperature, 10 to 15 minutes.

Meanwhile, whisk yogurt, tahini, water, vinegar, lemon juice and the remaining 1/8 teaspoon salt in a large bowl.

Add kale and massage with the dressing to soften the leaves. 

Add pear, onion and 1/2 cup mint and toss to combine.

Serve the salad topped with feta, the remaining 1/2 cup mint and the seeds.
