Ingredients
1 pound fresh prepared whole-wheat pizza dough

1 tablespoon olive oil

¾ teaspoon kosher salt, divided

½ teaspoon black pepper, divided

8 ounces fresh mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced

2 cups baby heirloom tomatoes, halved or quartered

½ cup loosely packed fresh basil leaves

Directions

Place a 17- x 12-inch baking sheet in oven; preheat oven to 450 degrees F.

Brush dough evenly with oil; sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon of the salt and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper.
