1 pound shell-on deveined raw shrimp (36-40 per pound; see Tip)

3 tablespoons cornstarch

¾ teaspoon salt, divided

1 teaspoon ground black pepper

1 teaspoon ground white pepper

5 tablespoons canola oil, divided

1 pound snow peas

1 serrano or jalapeño pepper, thinly sliced

Directions

Toss shrimp with cornstarch, 1/2 teaspoon salt, black pepper and white pepper in a large bowl.

Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a large flat-bottom wok or cast-iron skillet over high heat until shimmering.

Add half the shrimp and cook, stirring occasionally, until crisp and pink, about 2 minutes. 

Transfer to a plate with a slotted spoon. 

Add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil to the pan and repeat with the remaining shrimp. 

Sprinkle the shrimp with 1/8 teaspoon salt.

Add snow peas, serrano (or jalapeño) and garlic to the pan and cook, stirring occasionally, for 1 minute.
