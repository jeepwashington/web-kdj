Ingredients

1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil

1 pound sirloin steak, thinly sliced

1 (1-ounce) packet 30%-lower-sodium taco seasoning

1 cup frozen corn kernels, thawed

1 cup red enchilada sauce

1 (15 ounce) can no-salt-added black beans, rinsed

½ cup shredded Mexican cheese blend

4 (6-inch) whole-wheat tortillas, cut into 1-inch strips

2 cups hot cooked brown rice

¼ cup chopped fresh cilantro



Directions

Heat a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat for 5 minutes. 

Add oil; swirl to coat. Add steak and taco seasoning; cook, stirring occasionally, until the steak is browned, about 5 minutes.

Transfer to a plate. Do not wipe out the pan.

Add corn, enchilada sauce and black beans to the pan; stir with a wooden spoon, scraping the bottom of the pan to incorporate browned bits.

Bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low. 

Add cheese; cook, stirring, until the cheese is melted and sauce is creamy, 1 to 2 minutes. 

Gently stir in tortilla strips and the steak. Serve over rice and sprinkle with cilantro.
