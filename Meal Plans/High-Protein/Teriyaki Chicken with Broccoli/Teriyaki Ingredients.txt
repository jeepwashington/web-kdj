Ingredients
1 tablespoon grapeseed oil

1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch pieces

3 cups fresh broccoli florets (8 oz.)

¼ cup lower-sodium tamari

2 tablespoons pineapple juice

1 ½ tablespoons honey

1 tablespoon rice vinegar

2 teaspoons grated garlic

2 teaspoons cornstarch

1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger

2 (8.8 ounce) pouches precooked microwaveable brown rice, prepared according to package directions

¼ cup thinly sliced scallions

1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds



Directions

Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat.

Add chicken; cook, stirring often, until browned and mostly cooked, about 6 minutes.

Add broccoli; cook, stirring often, until bright green and tender, about 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, stir together tamari, pineapple juice, honey, vinegar, garlic, cornstarch and ginger in a small bowl.

Add the tamari mixture to the chicken mixture in the pan. Cook over high heat, stirring constantly,
until the liquid is thickened and the mixture is glazed, about 20 seconds.

Remove from heat.

Serve the chicken mixture over rice; sprinkle evenly with scallions and sesame seeds.
