Ingredients

1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil

8 cups chopped kale

¼ cup water

2 cups shredded or diced cooked chicken

1 teaspoon ground cumin

¼ teaspoon salt

¼ teaspoon ground pepper

1 (10 ounce) can red enchilada sauce (1 1/4 cups)

¼ cup sour cream

2-3 tablespoons minced chipotles in adobo

12 corn tortillas

¾ cup diced white onion, divided

1 ½ cups shredded Mexican blend cheese, divided



Directions

Preheat oven to 450 degrees F.

Heat oil in a large cast-iron skillet (12-inch) over medium-high heat. Add kale and water; cook, stirring, until bright green and wilted, about 2 minutes. Stir in chicken, cumin, salt and pepper; cook for 1 minute more. Transfer to a large bowl.

Combine enchilada sauce, sour cream and chipotles to taste in a small bowl. Spread 1/2 cup of the mixture in the pan. Place 4 tortillas over the sauce, overlapping them to cover the bottom. Top with half the chicken mixture, 1/4 cup onion and 1/2 cup cheese. Layer on half the remaining sauce, 4 tortillas, the remaining chicken, 1/4 cup onion and 1/2 cup cheese. Top with the remaining tortillas, sauce and cheese.

Bake the enchiladas until bubbling, 12 to 15 minutes. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 cup onion before serving.
