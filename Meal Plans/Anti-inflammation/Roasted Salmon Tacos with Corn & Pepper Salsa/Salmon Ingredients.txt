Ingredients

2 teaspoons honey

1 canned chipotle pepper in adobo, finely chopped

1 teaspoon Dijon mustard

1 teaspoon fresh lime juice plus 2 tablespoons, divided

1 ¼ pounds center-cut salmon fillet

½ teaspoon kosher salt, divided

1 ½ cups fresh corn kernels (from 3 ears)

1 red bell pepper, finely chopped

2 scallions, thinly sliced on the bias

1 small jalapeño pepper, seeded and finely diced

½ cup chopped fresh cilantro

8 corn tortillas, warmed

1 avocado, sliced

1 lime, quartered


Directions

Preheat oven to 425°F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with foil and coat lightly with cooking spray.

Combine honey, chipotle, mustard and 1 teaspoon lime juice in a small bowl.

Place salmon skin-side down on the prepared baking sheet; sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon salt.

Roast for 14 minutes. Remove from oven; spread the honey-chipotle glaze over the fish and continue roasting until cooked through, 2 to 4 minutes.

Meanwhile, combine corn, bell pepper, scallions, jalapeño, cilantro and the remaining 2 tablespoons lime juice and 1/4 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl; toss to combine.

Remove and discard salmon skin; flake the salmon. Serve in warmed tortillas, topped with avocado and the corn-and-pepper salsa. Serve with lime wedges.
