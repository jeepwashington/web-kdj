Ingredients

3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil

1 pound mixed mushrooms, such as maitake, shiitake, oyster and/or cremini, trimmed and halved

1 medium onion, chopped

3 cloves garlic, grated, divided

1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme

1 tablespoon tomato paste

¾ teaspoon salt

½ teaspoon ground pepper, divided

¼ cup dry white wine

1 (15 ounce) can no-salt-added diced tomatoes

½ cup part-skim ricotta cheese

¼ cup chopped fresh herbs, such as tarragon and/or parsley, plus more for garnish

8 ounces pappardelle pasta, preferably whole-wheat



Directions

Put a large pot of water on to boil.

Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. 

Add mushrooms and cook, stirring once, until browned, about 4 minutes. 

Add onion, two-thirds of the garlic and thyme; cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion is translucent, about 3 minutes.

Add tomato paste, salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. 

Stir in wine and tomatoes and bring to a simmer. Cover and cook for 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, combine ricotta, herbs, the remaining garlic and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl.

Cook pasta in the boiling water according to package directions.

Using tongs or a slotted spoon, transfer the pasta directly to the skillet, allowing some of the pasta-cooking water to drip into the pan.

Cook, stirring, until the pasta is coated with the sauce, about 1 minute. 

Serve the pasta topped with the ricotta mixture and more herbs, if desired.
