Ingredients

2 (8-ounce) boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch cubes

1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper

1/8 teaspoon salt

2 tablespoons canola oil, divided

8 cups broccoli florets

1/4 cup water plus 1 tablespoon, divided

3/4 cup unsalted chicken broth

2 1/2 tablespoons hoisin sauce

1 1/2 tablespoons lower-sodium soy sauce

1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil

1 1/2 teaspoons grated fresh ginger

1 1/2 teaspoons grated garlic

1 1/2 teaspoons seasoned rice vinegar

1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper

1 tablespoon cornstarch

1/4 cup sliced scallions

1 teaspoon white sesame seeds


Directions

Evenly season chicken with black pepper and salt.

Heat 1 tablespoon canola oil in a large nonstick skillet or wok over medium heat.

Add the chicken; cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned and a thermometer inserted in the thickest parts 165Â°F, 7 to 8 minutes. 

Transfer to a plate.

Do not wipe the pan clean.

Return the pan to medium heat. 

Add broccoli and the remaining 1 tablespoon canola oil; stir until the florets are fully coated. 

Add 1/4 cup water; cover, and cook, undisturbed, until the broccoli is bright green and tender-crisp, about 2 minutes.

Whisk broth, hoisin, soy sauce, sesame oil, ginger, garlic, vinegar and white pepper together in a small bowl until fully combined.

Pour the mixture over the broccoli; continue cooking over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture reduces by one-quarter, about 3 minutes.

Whisk cornstarch and the remaining 1 tablespoon water together in a small bowl.

Add to the pan; cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce has slightly thickened and coats the back of a spoon, about 1 minute.

Reduce heat to low.

Add the chicken; cook, stirring, until evenly coated and heated through, about 3 minutes.

Sprinkle with scallions and sesame seeds.
